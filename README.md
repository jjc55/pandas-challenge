Module 4 Challenge on Pandas

For Module 4, I am serving as the Chief Data Scientist for a certain school district. I am analyzing students' test results and looking for trends. I am specifically finding summary data on students' performance at the district and school level. I am also ranking the top 5 schools with the highest overall passing rate and the bottom 5 schools with the worst overall passing rate. I am also analzying math and reading scores by grade, school budget, school size, and school type. Later, I will share my findings with the mayor who work strategically to improve the education system.
